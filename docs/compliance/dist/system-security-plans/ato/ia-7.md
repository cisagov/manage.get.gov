# ia-7 - \[catalog\] Cryptographic Module Authentication

## Control Statement

Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.

## Control guidance

Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that role.

## Control assessment-objective

mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module are implemented that meet the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.
