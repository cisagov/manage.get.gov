# cm-4 - \[catalog\] Impact Analyses

## Control Statement

Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts prior to change implementation.

## Control guidance

Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as the security or privacy ramifications. Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to understand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect the controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners with stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if additional controls are required.

## Control assessment-objective

changes to the system are analyzed to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation;
changes to the system are analyzed to determine potential privacy impacts prior to change implementation.
