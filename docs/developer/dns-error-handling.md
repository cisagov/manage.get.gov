## Executive Summary

DNS hosting errors bubble up inconsistently today. The same failure can surface as a generic "Failed to save DNS record." message, a bare JSON error, or a Django 500 — with no correlation ID tying any of it back to an upstream Cloudflare request. This proposal defines a consistent error-handling pattern from the service layer to the UI and `/admin`, captured in ~12 sub-tickets.

**What changes for users**

- 4xx errors (zone not found, record conflict, validation, rate limit) become specific, actionable inline messages.
- 5xx errors (upstream timeout, auth failure, provider outage) show a single consistent "we couldn't reach our DNS provider" message with a `request_id` the user can quote to support.

**What changes for engineers**

- Typed exceptions (`DnsHostingError` hierarchy with eight codes) replace the bare `APIError`.
- httpx clients get explicit timeouts and a retry policy.
- Every DNS log line emits a structured field set (request_id, zone_id, cf_ray, error_code, duration_ms, …) so OpenSearch queries stop being string grep.
- One JSON error envelope: `{status, code, message, request_id}`.

**What changes for support and content teams**

- `/admin` gains audit coverage for DNS model changes via `django-auditlog`, plus deep-link helpers on the domain page that jump to auditlog entries for the domain's DNS models and to OpenSearch pre-filtered by `request_id` for failure investigation.
- **User-facing error copy moves from spreadsheets to an admin-editable table — a significant process improvement.** Today a single word change in an error message costs a Jira ticket, a developer context-switch, a code review, and a deploy. After this change, design or product self-serves the edit in `/admin`; the new copy is live to users on the next request via cache invalidation. See 17 for the full benefits and workflow — this is one of the larger-lift items in the proposal and one of the highest-leverage wins for cross-team velocity.

**Decisions we need from stakeholders before we start**

- Design: review or claim ownership of the 4xx message copy in 11.
- Product/security: editorial policy for admin-edited messages — trust the audit log, or require review before an edit goes live? (17.5)
- **Proposed out of scope, parked for leadership:** whether to adopt a dedicated request-tracing tool (e.g., OpenTelemetry). That is a program-level architectural decision spanning every service the team owns — one that sits above the DNS hosting epic. What this epic delivers — OpenSearch + structured fields — lets us reconstruct a failed request's full lifecycle with a single `request_id:"..."` query (browser action → middleware → DB → service → Cloudflare), which is sufficient for DNS error-handling needs. The broader tracing-tool question is filed as #4930 for a future leadership conversation and should not gate this epic's delivery. See [section 13](#13-request-tracing-is-opensearch-enough) for the comparison.

Full detail follows.

## 1. Why this document exists

Today DNS failures bubble up inconsistently across the `CloudflareService` → `DnsHostService` → view stack:

- `CloudflareService` catches `httpx.RequestError` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, logs, and re-raises.
- `DnsHostService` sometimes wraps with `APIError(str(e))`, sometimes doesn't.
- The view catches `(APIError, RequestError)` and shows a generic "Failed to save DNS record." regardless of whether the cause was auth, rate limit, missing zone, or network blip.
- HTMX responses mix `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}` and `{"error": "..."}` — the frontend special-cases both.
- No correlation ID ties the user-visible error to the OpenSearch log line.
- Support cannot trace a reported failure from `/admin` back to the upstream Cloudflare request.

This document defines a consistent pattern — where errors are caught, what they're wrapped in, what gets logged, what the user sees, and what `/admin` sees — so any developer picking up a DNS ticket has a single source of truth.

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

- **One error contract from upstream to UI.** Typed exceptions in the backend → one JSON envelope on the wire → one user-facing template strategy.
- **Correlation.** Every user-visible DNS error carries a `request_id` that matches a specific line in OpenSearch and (for DNS operations) a row in `/admin`.
- **Consistency over granularity.** Seven named exception subclasses.
- **Resilience defaults.** Timeouts and retries always set explicitly.
- **Clear policy.** "When do we give up?" "What do admins see?" "What can we log?".

### Non-goals

- **Adopting a dedicated distributed-tracing tool.** Deferred to the spike ([section 13](#13-request-tracing-is-opensearch-enough)). `request_id` in OpenSearch is the floor, and for our one-app-plus-Cloudflare topology it may well be the ceiling too.
- **Redesigning the DNS form validation layer.** In-model / in-form validation (`validations.py`, `models/dns/dns_record.py` `.clean()`) is solid and out of scope.
- **Cross-cutting log-format changes.** The JSON formatter in `config/settings.py` stays as-is; we extend it with new structured fields and leave the formatter itself unchanged.
- **A new CSS/UX design for errors.** We reuse the existing USWDS alert components and the Django messages framework. Design consultation (see [section 10](#10-user-facing-error-messaging)) may refine the specific copy.

## 3. Current state (before this work)

### 3.1 Service layer

- [`src/registrar/services/cloudflare_service.py`](../../src/registrar/services/cloudflare_service.py) — every method catches `httpx.RequestError` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, logs an f-string, and re-raises as-is. Two methods (`create_dns_record`, `update_dns_record`) additionally wrap with `APIError(...)` on `HTTPStatusError`. The `httpx.Client()` is constructed with no timeout and no retries.
- [`src/registrar/services/dns_host_service.py`](../../src/registrar/services/dns_host_service.py) — wraps with `raise APIError(str(e)) from e` in `create_dns_record` and `update_and_save_dns_record`. Other methods pass exceptions through unchanged.

### 3.2 View layer

- [`src/registrar/views/domain.py`](../../src/registrar/views/domain.py) `DomainDNSRecordsView.post` catches `(APIError, RequestError)`, logs, and shows a generic `messages.error(request, "Failed to save DNS record.")`. For a missing zone, returns `JsonResponse({"status": "error", "message": "DNS zone not found. Domain may not be enrolled."}, status=400)`.
- The 500 handler in [`src/registrar/views/utility/error_views.py`](../../src/registrar/views/utility/error_views.py) renders `500.html` which has a "log identifier" block that is currently a placeholder.

### 3.3 Exception classes

[`src/registrar/utility/errors.py`](../../src/registrar/utility/errors.py) already has a mature code-based pattern: `NameserverError` + `NameserverErrorCodes`, `DsDataError` + `DsDataErrorCodes`, `SecurityEmailError` + `SecurityEmailErrorCodes`. DNS hosting has only a bare `APIError(Exception)` — no subclasses, no codes, no status propagation. We mirror the `NameserverError` pattern for DNS hosting.

### 3.4 Logging

- [`src/registrar/logging_context.py`](../../src/registrar/logging_context.py) uses `ContextVar` for `user_email`, `ip_address`, `request_path`.
- [`RequestLoggingMiddleware`](../../src/registrar/registrar_middleware.py) sets those ContextVars. **Note:** currently guarded by `if getattr(settings, "IS_PRODUCTION", False)`, which means local development logs are missing this context entirely.
- [`DatabaseConnectionMiddleware`](../../src/registrar/registrar_middleware.py) reads `HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID` directly from `request.META` — not propagated to anyone else.
- `JsonFormatter` in [`config/settings.py`](../../src/registrar/config/settings.py) emits JSON logs and merges `extra=` kwargs into the log record. OpenSearch-ready.
- No correlation ID in the DNS service logs. No `cf_ray` captured. No `duration_ms`. No `error_code`. (Prototype branch `dg/4893-error-handling-improvements-proto` has since added `cf_ray` capture on `create_dns_record` and `update_dns_record`, and verified end-to-end on 2026-04-23 against the live Cloudflare API — a real ray ID of the form `9f0fb528c8e290be-IAD` is now logged on success and present in `DnsNotFoundError.context["cf_ray"]` on 404. See [section 17](#17-integration-with-in-flight-prototype-work).)

### 3.5 Admin

[`DnsRecordAdmin`](../../src/registrar/admin.py) is minimal: list/search on fields. **No ModelAdmin** exists for `DnsAccount`, `DnsZone`, or `DnsVendor`. Support staff cannot see DNS operation history in `/admin` today.

```

- **Services raise.** Never return sentinels, never swallow.
- **View catches.** One `except DnsHostingError as exc:` block per DNS endpoint, delegates to `dns_error_response(exc)` helper.
- **`request_id` threads through** via ContextVar, into every log line, into the JSON envelope, into `500.html`, and into the OpenSearch record for deep-dive investigation.
- **Successful DNS changes are audited via `django-auditlog`** on the DNS models (`DnsRecord`, `DnsZone`, `DnsAccount`). This is the pattern the registrar already uses for domains and other resources — no new table. Admin deep-link helpers on the domain page jump to the auditlog entries for that domain.
- **Failure investigations go through OpenSearch**, reached via one-click deep-link from `/admin` pre-filtered by `request_id` or domain name. Support doesn't have to know Lucene syntax; the link is built for them.
- **User-facing message text is resolved at render time** by `DnsHostingError.message`: explicit override → admin-edited row in `DnsErrorMessage` (keyed by code, edited in `/admin`, cached in-process with signal invalidation) → code-level `_error_mapping` fallback. The DB is authoritative; the code dict is the safety net. See [section 16](#16-admin-editable-error-message-store) for the full design and [section 16.6](#16-admin-editable-error-message-store) for the deploy / seed contract.

## 5. Decisions that apply across the whole epic

These are answered once, here, so every sub-ticket starts from the same answer — no re-debate in individual PRs.

| Question (from original issue) | Decision |
|---|---|
| Security/privacy: what can we log? | Field-level allow/deny list (see [section 8](#8-pii-and-log-hygiene)). `user_email` and client IP inherit existing retention policy. |
| Frontend error shape? | JSON envelope: `{status, code, message, request_id}`. See [section 9](#9-api-error-envelope-contract). |
| Which errors to surface in /admin? | Successful changes via `django-auditlog` on DNS models; failures via OpenSearch reached through a deep-link from the domain admin page. See [section 11](#11-admin-visibility-and-support-workflow). |
| How specific should API error types be? | Seven subclasses. See [section 6](#6-error-code-vocabulary). Coarse categories beat sprawling taxonomies. |
| request_id / trace_id passthrough? | Yes — `request_id_var` ContextVar, set in `RequestLoggingMiddleware`, echoed in response header and JSON envelope. Full distributed tracing deferred to the spike ([section 13](#13-request-tracing-is-opensearch-enough)). |
| How to display 500 errors? | Generic "we couldn't reach our DNS provider" message + `request_id`. See [section 10](#10-user-facing-error-messaging). |
| Distinguish 4xx vs 5xx in the UX? | Yes. 4xx → actionable inline error. 5xx → generic + request_id. See [section 10](#10-user-facing-error-messaging). |
| How to bubble up errors? | Log at the source with structured fields, raise a typed `DnsHostingError` subclass. Never log-and-swallow. Never convert to `None` in place of raising. See [section 4](#4-target-architecture) and [section 14](#14-exception-contract-for-contributors). |
| Pickling? | Exceptions must be picklable. See [section 14](#14-exception-contract-for-contributors). |
| httpx recommendations? | Explicit timeouts, transport retries on idempotent calls only, manual backoff on 429/5xx w/ Retry-After. See [section 12](#12-httpx-resilience-policy). |
| When do we "give up"? | At the view layer. Services never terminate user flows. See [section 4](#4-target-architecture). |
| Admin vs end-user detail? | Admin sees structured summary + `cf_ray` + upstream status. End-user sees code + message + `request_id`. Neither sees the raw Python traceback. See [section 11](#11-admin-visibility-and-support-workflow). |
| Retry strategy? | Only for idempotent HTTP methods. Honor `Retry-After`. Cap attempts. See [section 12](#12-httpx-resilience-policy). |
| Log schema for OpenSearch? | JSON formatter already exists. Extend with the field list in [section 8](#8-pii-and-log-hygiene). |
| Request tracing beyond OpenSearch? | OpenSearch + structured fields covers most of our needs; spike decides if we need more. See [section 13](#13-request-tracing-is-opensearch-enough). |
| High-priority errors? | Visible via OpenSearch filters on `error_code` (reached from `/admin` via deep-link). |

## 6. Error-code vocabulary

Defined on `DnsHostingErrorCodes(IntEnum)` and raised via `DnsHostingError` subclasses in `utility/errors.py`, mirroring `NameserverError`.

| Wire code | Enum | Subclass | Upstream status | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | `ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | `DnsNotFoundError` | 404 | 4xx |
| `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | `RECORD_CONFLICT` | `DnsValidationError` | 409 | 4xx |
| `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | `DnsValidationError` | 400 | 4xx |
| `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `DnsRateLimitError` | 429 | 4xx (retryable) |
| `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` | `AUTH_FAILED` | `DnsAuthError` | 401 / 403 | 5xx-equivalent |
| `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | `DnsTransportError` | (none) | 5xx |
| `DNS_UPSTREAM_ERROR` | `UPSTREAM_ERROR` | `DnsUpstreamError` | 5xx | 5xx |
| `DNS_UNKNOWN` | `UNKNOWN` | `DnsHostingError` (base) | any | 5xx |

Every `DnsHostingError` carries: `code` (enum), `message` (from `_error_mapping`), `upstream_status` (int or None), `context` (dict of primitives). Subclasses are categories; finer distinctions belong in `code` and `context`.

## 7. Captured-errors catalog

This catalog is the reference for every DNS failure condition we know about today. Update when a new code is added.

| Source | Trigger | Code | User surface | Admin surface | Log level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare 404 on `POST /zones/.../dns_records` | Zone record not found (stale local DB, race, test fixture) | `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | Inline: "We couldn't find the DNS zone for this domain. It may not be enrolled in DNS hosting yet." | OpenSearch log line with `error_code=DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | `warning` |
| Cloudflare 409 | Duplicate record (same name+type) | `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | Inline field error | log row | `warning` |
| Cloudflare 400 | Invalid record content (field Cloudflare refuses) | `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | Inline field error (reuse CF's human-readable reason when safe) | log row | `warning` |
| Cloudflare 429 | Rate limit | `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | "You're making changes too quickly — please wait a moment and try again." | log row; backoff metadata visible | `warning` |
| Cloudflare 401 / 403 | Invalid auth token or scope | `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` | Generic "couldn't reach DNS provider" + `request_id` | log row; critical | `error` |
| httpx `ConnectTimeout` / `ReadTimeout` / `WriteTimeout` | Network blip, Cloudflare slowdown | `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | Generic + `request_id`, encourage retry | log row; duration_ms present | `error` |
| httpx `ConnectError` / `NetworkError` / DNS failure | Loss of connectivity to Cloudflare | `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` (catch-all for transport) | Generic + `request_id` | log row | `error` |
| Cloudflare 5xx | Provider outage | `DNS_UPSTREAM_ERROR` | Generic + `request_id` | log row | `error` |
| Any other Cloudflare status | Unexpected | `DNS_UNKNOWN` | Generic + `request_id` | log row with full upstream body (redacted) | `error` |
| Local model/form validation (existing, out of scope) | Invalid TTL, MX priority, CNAME conflict, bad DNS name | (raises `ValidationError` instead of `DnsHostingError`) | Inline form field error | Django admin default | `debug` |

Post-launch: add a row every time a new production incident surfaces a code we hadn't catalogued.

## 8. PII and log hygiene

The registrar is a government system. We treat application log streams as subject to the same handling posture as application data.

### 8.1 Safe to log unmasked

- `request_id` — UUID or externally-provided, no PII.
- `dns_account_id` — vendor account tag (Cloudflare).
- `zone_id` — vendor zone ID.
- `record_id` — vendor DNS record ID.
- `cf_ray` — Cloudflare `cf-ray` response header. Availability verified end-to-end (real ray IDs returned on both success and error paths; see [section 17](#17-integration-with-in-flight-prototype-work)).
- `upstream_status` — HTTP status integer.
- `error_code` — `DnsHostingErrorCodes` name.
- `duration_ms` — integer latency.
- `attempt` — integer retry counter.
- `outcome` — `"success"` or `"failure"`.
- Operation name — `"create_record"`, `"update_zone_dns_settings"`, etc.

### 8.2 Restricted / conditional

- `user_email` — PII, carried in `logging_context.user_email_var`. Already logged today; this epic inherits existing retention policy.
- Client IP — `logging_context.ip_address_var`. Same treatment as `user_email`.

### 8.3 Never log

- Request bodies. DNS record `content` may contain secrets (TXT used for service tokens, DKIM keys, etc.).
- `X-Auth-Email`, `X-Auth-Key`, `Authorization`, or any Cloudflare credential.
- Django session cookies or CSRF tokens.
- Raw stack traces in any user-facing surface (UI, admin, 500 page). Tracebacks stay in OpenSearch.
- Upstream response bodies without redaction when logged to OpenSearch (truncate ≤ 2 KB, scrub token-like patterns).

### 8.4 Redaction

When DNS service code logs an upstream response body to OpenSearch, it truncates to ≤ 2 KB and scrubs token-like patterns before logging. Use a conservative allow-list (leave Cloudflare error codes and human-readable reasons; redact anything matching typical secret patterns). Implementation belongs in a small utility covered by unit tests.

## 9. API error envelope contract

Every DNS endpoint returns this exact shape on error:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "We couldn't find the DNS zone for this domain.",
  "request_id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7890-1234-567890abcdef"
}
```

HTTP status derived from severity: 4xx codes → 400 / 409 / 429; 5xx codes → 502 (upstream), 504 (timeout), 500 (unknown). `code` is ALL_CAPS_SNAKE from [section 6](#6-error-code-vocabulary); `message` comes from `_error_mapping`; `request_id` echoes the ContextVar so users can quote it to support.

Construction lives in `utility/api_responses.dns_error_response(exc)`. Frontend reads `code` and `message`, not the HTTP status, for presentation logic.

The bare `{"error": "..."}` shape used by some legacy API views is **retired for DNS endpoints only**. Non-DNS endpoints are not in scope for this change.

## 10. User-facing error messaging

Design review of this copy is **required** before [#4925](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4925) merges — filed as [#4950](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4950). These strings become the initial `DnsErrorMessage` rows ([section 16](#16-admin-editable-error-message-store)); after sign-off, design edits them in `/admin` without a dev cycle.

### 4xx — actionable inline errors

Shown as USWDS alert components or inline field errors adjacent to the offending input.

| Code | Copy |
|---|---|
| `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | We couldn't find the DNS zone for this domain. It may not be enrolled in DNS hosting yet. |
| `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | A record with that name and type already exists. Edit the existing record instead. |
| `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | `<reuse Cloudflare's reason when safe, e.g., "The IP address isn't in a valid format.">` |
| `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | You're making changes too quickly. Please wait a moment and try again. |

### 5xx — generic fallback with correlation ID

Shown as a USWDS alert at the page level. Never inline.

> We couldn't reach our DNS provider. Please try again in a moment. If the problem persists, contact <help@get.gov> and include this reference: `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7890-1234-567890abcdef`.

For unhandled 500s, the existing `500.html` "log identifier" block is wired to `request_id` by ticket #9.

### Tags

Reuse the existing Django messages tagging convention already in the `base.html` template (`GenericError`, `NameserverError`, etc.). Add `DnsError` as a new tag so CSS can differentiate if design wants different treatment.

## 11. Admin visibility and support workflow

Admin visibility uses infrastructure the registrar already has — `django-auditlog` for successful model changes, OpenSearch for failure investigation — plus one piece of new UX: deep-link helpers from the domain admin page into both.

### 11.1 How successful DNS changes are audited

`django-auditlog` is already used across the registrar. Registering `DnsRecord`, `DnsZone`, and `DnsAccount` adds audit coverage — every create / update / delete produces an entry with user, timestamp, and field-level diff. Auditlog does NOT capture failures (no model was saved, so no entry); failures go to OpenSearch ([section 11.3](#11-admin-visibility-and-support-workflow)).

### 11.2 How failures are investigated

Failures land in OpenSearch as JSON log lines with structured fields ([section 3](#3-current-state-before-this-work)): `request_id`, `dns_account_id`, `zone_id`, `record_id`, `cf_ray`, `upstream_status`, `error_code`, `duration_ms`. A single OpenSearch query `request_id:"..."` reconstructs the full lifecycle of a failed DNS action — middleware → DB → service → Cloudflare.

### 11.3 Which DNS operations show up, and where

**One-liner test for contributors:** *"If a user could reasonably report 'I tried to X and something went wrong,' X should be captured."*

| Operation | Triggered by | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| Create DNS record | User submits the form | Success → auditlog on `DnsRecord`. Failure → OpenSearch. |
| Update DNS record | User edits a record | Success → auditlog on `DnsRecord`. Failure → OpenSearch. |
| Delete DNS record | User deletes a record | Success → auditlog on `DnsRecord`. Failure → OpenSearch. |
| Enroll domain in DNS hosting | Admin action | Success → auditlog on `DnsAccount` / `DnsZone`. Failure → OpenSearch. |
| Unenroll domain | Admin action | Success → auditlog. Failure → OpenSearch. |
| Update zone DNS settings | Admin action | Success → auditlog on `DnsZone`. Failure → OpenSearch. |

**Operations that explicitly do NOT get captured:**

- Read-only lookups (`get_zone_by_id`, `get_account_zones`, `get_dns_record`).
- Internal helper calls inside an orchestration flow (sub-calls inside enrollment).
- Background sync, periodic polls, health probes (if / when those exist).
- Form-validation failures that never reach the DNS service layer. They surface inline on the form and never touch Cloudflare, so auditlog sees nothing and OpenSearch has nothing DNS-specific to show.

### 11.4 Deep-link helpers from the domain admin page

From a domain's admin detail page, add two links:

- **"DNS audit trail for this domain"** → auditlog list pre-filtered by the domain's `DnsRecord` / `DnsZone` / `DnsAccount` object IDs.
- **"DNS logs in OpenSearch for this domain"** → pre-built OpenSearch URL filtered by `domain_name` (or `request_id` if the ticket quotes one).

### 11.5 What admins do NOT see in `/admin`

Raw Python tracebacks, unredacted upstream response bodies, request bodies, and Cloudflare credentials. Tracebacks stay in OpenSearch; an engineer fetches them by `request_id` when needed.

### 11.6 Retention

No new retention plumbing. Auditlog follows existing registrar policy; OpenSearch follows infra's existing log policy. Confirm with infra before launch that DNS-hosting fields are covered.

## 12. httpx resilience policy

### 12.1 Timeouts

`httpx.Timeout(connect=3, read=10, write=10, pool=5)` on every DNS client.

### 12.2 Transport retries

`httpx.HTTPTransport(retries=2)`. Low-level connect-error retries only; safe at the transport layer for any method (httpx only retries before a response is received).

### 12.3 Manual retry w/ backoff

Idempotent methods only (GET, HEAD). Conditions:

- HTTP 429 → honor `Retry-After` (seconds). Cap at 3 total attempts.
- HTTP 5xx → exponential backoff with jitter (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s). Cap at 3 total attempts.
- `RequestError` (timeout, network) → backoff identical to 5xx. Cap at 3 total attempts.

### 12.4 Mutating methods

No automatic retry on POST, PATCH, DELETE — Cloudflare doesn't universally accept an idempotency key, and retrying a slow-but-successful POST can create duplicate records.

### 12.5 Circuit breaker (explicitly deferred)

We do not implement a circuit breaker. `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` and sustained `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` failures are visible in OpenSearch (reached via the domain admin deep-link) for human intervention.

## 13. Request tracing: is OpenSearch enough?

**OpenSearch is the incumbent and already gets us most of the way.** The spike (#4930) decides whether the remaining gap justifies adopting a dedicated tracing tool.

### 13.1 What OpenSearch + structured log fields already gives us

Once the DNS-hosting work in this proposal is complete, every log line across middleware, DB queries, service calls, and httpx requests carries `request_id`, `zone_id`, `record_id`, `dns_account_id`, `error_code`, `upstream_status`, `cf_ray`, and `duration_ms`. A single query in OpenSearch —

```
request_id: "1a2b3c4d-..."
```

— returns the full lifecycle of one user action in chronological order, including the Cloudflare side via `cf_ray`. Support can act on this without SSO-ing into anywhere new.

### 13.2 What OpenSearch does not give us

- **Automatic span instrumentation.** Tracing tools include Django, DB, and httpx plugins that emit structured spans for free. With OpenSearch we emit a log line at every hop and pay the author-cost forever.
- **Parent-child relationships / flame graphs.** Answering "how much of the 2.3s was DB vs. Cloudflare vs. rendering?" is possible but manual: you read duration_ms fields across log lines. A tracing tool renders this as a waterfall.
- **Standardized wire format for future services.** Tracing tools speak industry-standard span formats; any future service we add (or vendor we integrate with) can emit spans a tracing backend ingests directly. Flat log records don't travel that way.
- **Sampling & retention tuned for traces.** Log retention is chosen for logs; trace retention is usually shorter with heavier sampling on busy paths.

### 13.3 What the spike needs to answer

Only one question: **is the gap in 13.2 big enough to justify adopting a new tool?**

Default answer should be "OpenSearch is enough" — we have one app talking to one vendor, already pay for OpenSearch, and support's `request_id` workflow is already served by structured logs + auditlog. For each alternative considered, document: the specific gap it fills, operating cost (infra, license, agent overhead), FedRAMP posture, rough weeks to adopt, and what changes in the shipped ContextVar + log-field work.

### 13.4 Decision ownership

If the spike recommends adopting a new tool **before** the API error envelope or structured-logging tickets start, the **team lead** decides whether to halt those tickets and pivot, or to proceed with them as planned and layer the new tool on top later. This is explicit so no dev in-flight has to make the call alone.

## 14. Exception contract for contributors

When adding a new `DnsHostingError` subclass or new `DnsHostingErrorCodes` value:

### 14.1 Pickle safety

Exceptions **must** survive `pickle.dumps(exc)` → `pickle.loads(...)` — the parallel test runner serializes exceptions across process boundaries. Rules: `__init__` takes only pickle-safe primitives (`str`, `int`, `dict` of primitives); no live `httpx.Response` objects, lambdas, closures, file handles, or generators. Add a round-trip test:

```python
def test_dns_hosting_error_is_picklable(self):
    exc = DnsNotFoundError(
        code=DnsHostingErrorCodes.ZONE_NOT_FOUND,
        upstream_status=404,
        context={"zone_id": "abc123", "cf_ray": "xyz"},
    )
    restored = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(exc))
    self.assertEqual(restored.code, exc.code)
    self.assertEqual(restored.upstream_status, exc.upstream_status)
    self.assertEqual(restored.context, exc.context)
```

### 14.2 Code/message mapping

- Every `DnsHostingErrorCodes` entry has a user-facing message in `_error_mapping`.
- Messages are written to be shown verbatim to an end user — no internal jargon, no Cloudflare terminology the user hasn't seen, no stack trace excerpts.
- 5xx codes share the generic template ([section 10](#10-user-facing-error-messaging)); the code differentiates them; the user-facing message text is the same.

### 14.3 Adding to the catalog

Update the [section 6](#6-error-code-vocabulary) vocabulary table, the `code.to_wire()` helper, and the [section 7](#7-captured-errors-catalog) errors catalog.

### 14.4 When in doubt

Start with `DNS_UNKNOWN`. Promote to a named code only when a pattern of production incidents justifies the distinction. Don't pre-invent codes for hypothetical Cloudflare responses we've never seen.

## 15. Support runbook — tracing a DNS failure

A user reports: "I tried to add an A record and got an error. It said the reference was `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7890-1234-567890abcdef`."

1. **Django `/admin` — domain page.** Navigate to the domain. Two deep-link helpers:
   - *DNS audit trail for this domain* → Django auditlog entries for `DnsRecord` / `DnsZone` / `DnsAccount`. Shows any successful changes recently (create/update/delete). Confirms whether the user's request actually persisted.
   - *DNS logs in OpenSearch for this domain* → OpenSearch pre-filtered by the domain name. Shows the full lifecycle of recent requests, including failures.
2. **OpenSearch by `request_id`.** Filter `request_id: "1a2b3c4d-..."` (click the admin deep-link, or paste the user's reference ID). Returns the full log trail: middleware → DB → service → Cloudflare. Look at `error_code`, `upstream_status`, `cf_ray`, `duration_ms`. For most tickets this is enough.
3. **Cloudflare support** → escalate using the `cf_ray` value from the OpenSearch log line. Do NOT share `request_id` with Cloudflare — it's our internal correlation ID.
4. **User-facing follow-up** → if the code was 4xx-user-correctable, point them to the inline guidance. If 5xx, confirm it's transient and ask them to retry; if sustained, escalate to the engineering team.

## 16. Admin-editable error message store

User-facing DNS error copy currently lives in spreadsheets that drift out of sync with code. The admin-editable message store ticket moves DNS hosting message text into a small admin-editable Django model so design and product can update copy in `/admin` without a deploy — and tests continue to pass because they reference the error **code** rather than a literal string.

### 16.0 Why this matters — process impact

Today, changing a single word in an error message costs a Jira ticket, an engineer context-switch, a code review, and a deploy — sometimes days of calendar time for a purely editorial change. After this ticket, design or product edits the row in `/admin` and the next request sees new copy, with no deploy and no engineer in the loop. `LogEntry` provides the audit trail automatically; the code-level `_error_mapping` dict is the fallback if the DB row is missing. Tests assert on `exc.code` rather than literal strings, so they stop breaking when copy changes.

**Trade-off to decide:** Do edits go live immediately, or require review before publish? Section 17.5 flags this as an open decision.

### 16.1 Scope: phase 1 (this epic)

- **DNS hosting only.** Just `DnsHostingErrorCodes` — 8 rows, one namespace.
- **Error messages only.** Form labels, success copy, and email templates are out of scope.
- **Pilot scope.** Proves the mechanism on a small, contained surface before applying it to higher-traffic, stakeholder-sensitive flows (`validations.py`, `NameserverError`, etc.).

### 16.1.1 Scope: phase 2 (proposed, pending proposal buy-in)

Once phase 1 is proven, phase 2 would migrate form validation messages in `validations.py` and the existing error namespaces (`NameserverError`, `DsDataError`, `SecurityEmailError`). Not filed yet; pending buy-in on the two-phase approach and what phase 1 reveals about cache/test/editor-UX issues.

### 16.2 Model

```python
class DnsErrorMessage(models.Model):
    namespace = models.CharField(max_length=32, default="dns")
    code = models.CharField(max_length=64)           # matches DnsHostingErrorCodes.name
    message = models.TextField()
    internal_notes = models.TextField(blank=True)    # "where this message appears"
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(fields=["namespace", "code"], name="dns_error_message_unique_namespace_code"),
        ]
```

### 16.3 Source-of-truth rules

- **Admin edits are authoritative.** Fixtures seed the initial rows on fresh environments; they never overwrite existing rows in staging or production.
- **Code-level `_error_mapping` is the fallback** — used only when the DB row is missing or the store is unreachable. Never a hard dependency on the DB.
- **Exceptions resolve lazily.** `DnsHostingError.message` is a property that reads from `utility/messages.get_user_message(namespace, code)` with the `_error_mapping` dict as the fallback. Admin edits take effect without a process restart via a `post_save` cache-invalidation signal.

### 16.3.1 How a runtime edit takes effect

The full chain when design edits a row in `/admin`:

1. Django saves the `DnsErrorMessage` row to the DB and fires a `post_save` signal.
2. The signal handler calls `invalidate_cache()`, clearing the in-process message cache (`utility/messages.py`).
3. The next request that raises a `DnsHostingError` calls `exc.message` (a lazy property).
4. The property calls `get_user_message("dns", code_name)`, which finds the cache empty, queries the `DnsErrorMessage` table, repopulates the cache, and returns the updated string.
5. That string is what the user sees — no deploy, no process restart.

### 16.3.2 Production edits and git

**Admin edits are runtime overrides, not the canonical record.** The code-level `_error_mapping` values are the git-tracked baseline — they live in source control and have a full commit history. A DB row in `DnsErrorMessage` overrides the code value for that environment at runtime, but it does not replace the git trace.

The intended workflow for a permanent copy change:

1. Edit the row in `/admin` for the immediate fix — the change is live on the next request.
2. Open a PR that updates the matching string in `_error_mapping` (and the seed migration if the initial value should also change). This creates the git record of the approved copy.
3. Once the PR merges, the DB override and the code value are in sync; the DB row can be left in place or cleared — both produce the same result.

This means:

- **Quick fixes go to `/admin` first** — no deploy needed, no one blocked.
- **Permanent changes land in code too** — so the git history reflects what's actually running, and a fresh environment gets the right text from the seed migration without needing a manual DB edit.
- **There is no auto-commit to `main`.** Admin edits are strictly a DB write; git is updated through a normal PR.

### 16.4 Test pattern

Tests must not assert on literal message strings — they would break every time product edits the copy. Two correct patterns:

```python
# Preferred — structured assertion on the error code.
self.assertEqual(exc.code, DnsHostingErrorCodes.ZONE_NOT_FOUND)

# When a test really does exercise the rendered user copy (e.g., an integration
# test against the HTMX fragment), fetch the current value at assertion time:
from registrar.utility.messages import get_user_message
expected = get_user_message("dns", "ZONE_NOT_FOUND") or <fallback>
self.assertIn(expected, response.content.decode())
```

### 16.5 Editor workflow (for design / product)

`/admin` → DNS error messages → find the row by `code` → edit → save. Change is live on the next request. `LogEntry` records the edit automatically.

### 16.6 Deploy / fixture contract

Initial values come from Design ([#4950](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4950)); the seed migration writes them into `DnsErrorMessage`. Fresh environments get all rows created; existing environments use `get_or_create` — never overwrite admin edits. Changes to `_error_mapping` fallback text are only user-visible where no DB row exists; update production copy through `/admin`.

### 16.7 Production edit workflow — change governance options

Once this table is live in production, someone will edit a message in `/admin` and then: *does this need to go back into git, and does it need review before it goes live?* 

Two paths:

**Path A — edits go live immediately, git gets a record after the fact.**
Admin saves the row → cache invalidates → users see the new copy on the next request. A scheduled job (nightly or on-demand) runs a management command that exports the current table state to a tracked fixture file and opens a draft PR against `main`. The PR is an audit artifact — the change is already live, and the team merges the PR at their leisure to keep git in sync. This preserves the "no deploy required" win entirely. The tradeoff: the PR is after-the-fact, and if it goes unmerged for a long time the fixture drifts from production.

**Path B — edits require a second person to approve before going live.**
`DnsErrorMessage` gets a `state` field (`draft` | `published`). Admin edits flip the row to `draft` automatically — change is *not* live yet. A second person with a "publisher" role uses an admin action to approve: *Publish selected messages* → flips to `published` → cache invalidates → now live. No deploy required, but a two-person workflow entirely inside `/admin`. The tradeoff: slightly more model complexity, and the self-serve speed benefit is reduced to "same day" instead of "same request."

**Which path to pick is a product decision** — see [decision #6 in section 18](#18-decisions-needed-from-stakeholders). Both are straightforward to build on top of the current implementation without redesigning the store.

## 17. Integration with in-flight prototype work

This section reconciles this design with parallel in-flight work on DNS error handling (a prototype PR that introduces `CloudflareValidationError` and hardcoded user-facing constants). Notes below capture how the prototype's artifacts map onto this design so the migration path is clear when the full typed-error and admin-editable-copy tickets are ready.

### 17.1 `cf_ray` availability is confirmed

Previous drafts of this document treated `cf_ray` capture as theoretical. As of 2026-04-23 it is verified end-to-end:

- `create_dns_record` and `update_dns_record` in [`cloudflare_service.py`](../../src/registrar/services/cloudflare_service.py) extract `resp.headers.get("cf-ray")` on both success and error paths and include it in log output.
- A real Cloudflare response carried `cf-ray=9f0fb528c8e290be-IAD` through the httpx client, into the log line, and into `DnsNotFoundError.context["cf_ray"]` on 404.
- Unit tests cover both branches of the read: header present ([`test_create_dns_record_404_raises_dns_not_found_error`](../../src/registrar/tests/services/test_cloudflare_service.py)) and header absent ([`test_create_dns_record_404_without_cf_ray_header`](../../src/registrar/tests/services/test_cloudflare_service.py)).

`cf_ray` is therefore a first-class field in the structured log set ([section 8.1](#8-pii-and-log-hygiene)) that support sees via the OpenSearch deep-link from `/admin` ([section 11](#11-admin-visibility-and-support-workflow)) — the remaining work is propagating capture to the other `CloudflareService` methods using a shared helper rather than re-deciding whether to capture it at all.

### 17.2 `CloudflareValidationError` → `DnsHostingError` subclass

The prototype's `CloudflareValidationError` is exactly the kind of specific, named exception the [section 6](#6-error-code-vocabulary) vocabulary envisions. When the typed-error hierarchy lands:

- `CloudflareValidationError` becomes (or is replaced by) `DnsValidationError` / `DnsRecordConflictError` extending `DnsHostingError`.
- Stable `DnsHostingErrorCodes` values — at minimum `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` and `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` (both already in [section 6](#6-error-code-vocabulary)) — are the wire contract. No catch-all "validation failed" code.
- Callers that currently `except CloudflareValidationError` migrate to `except DnsHostingError` + branch on `exc.code`.

Migration is mechanical — only the base class and code attribute need to change.

### 17.3 Hardcoded message constants → admin-editable store

The prototype stores user-facing copy (e.g., `CF_DUPLICATE_RECORD_MESSAGE`) as Python constants. That is the right tradeoff for an in-flight PR that must merge before the `DnsErrorMessage` table exists, but it recreates the spreadsheet-drift problem [section 16](#16-admin-editable-error-message-store) explicitly exists to eliminate.

When [section 16](#16-admin-editable-error-message-store) lands: replace each constant with `utility/messages.get_user_message("dns", <code>)`, keep the constant as the `_error_mapping` fallback, and add `# TODO(#4893/#4932): replace with get_user_message lookup` to every constant now so the migration is obvious.

### 17.4 View-layer mapping vs. the error envelope

The prototype's view layer emits per-field form errors (e.g., `{"name": "...", "content": "..."}`) so the DNS form can highlight the offending input. The [section 9](#9-api-error-envelope-contract) envelope contract currently returns one message per response, which is correct for non-form JSON endpoints but **insufficient** for the DNS record form UX.

Two viable resolutions — decide before the envelope ticket is split:

1. **Extend the envelope** with an optional `fields: {name: message, ...}` attribute for validation failures.
2. **Keep the view owning form-level mapping** — service raises `DnsValidationError` with `context={"field_errors": {...}}`, view renders per-field errors via Django form machinery, envelope reserved for non-form JSON endpoints.

(1) is more uniform; (2) matches how Django form errors are rendered elsewhere. Flag for the envelope ticket owner — do not silently pick one.

### 17.5 `cf_errors` raw payload → structured OpenSearch logging

The prototype attaches a `cf_errors` list (parsed from the Cloudflare error response body) to `CloudflareValidationError`. That list is exactly what the structured-logging ticket ([section 3](#3-current-state-before-this-work)) wants in OpenSearch — already parsed, free of credentials, and queryable by support.

When the structured-logging ticket lands, the DNS service can log:

```python
if getattr(exc, "cf_errors", None):
    log_extra["cf_errors"] = exc.cf_errors          # already structured
else:
    log_extra["cf_body"] = redact(response_body)[:2048]  # raw-text fallback
```

Action item for the typed-error ticket: **preserve `cf_errors` as a documented attribute on `DnsHostingError`** (optional, `list[dict] | None`), so the structured-logger has a single well-typed place to read structured upstream error data without re-parsing response bodies.

### 17.6 `request_id` on the prototype branch lives on the request object

The `request_id` ContextVar slot is declared in [`logging_context.py`](../../src/registrar/logging_context.py) (`request_id_var`), but on the prototype branch `dg/4893-error-handling-improvements-proto` the middleware does *not* yet write to it. Instead, [`RequestLoggingMiddleware`](../../src/registrar/registrar_middleware.py) stores the ID on `request._dns_request_id` and echoes it back as an `X-Request-ID` response header. Callers that need the ID read it via `getattr(request, "_dns_request_id", None)` — see [`utility/api_responses.get_request_id`](../../src/registrar/utility/api_responses.py).

Intentional prototype-scope choice — wiring through the shared `set_user_log_context()` API adds review surface and regression risk not needed to demonstrate the error flow. [#4924](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4924) is the proper home; once it lands, every `request._dns_request_id` reference migrates to `request_id_var.get()`.

## 18. Decisions needed from stakeholders
