DNS errors today are inconsistent: users get vague messages, support can't trace problems, services log the same failure three times. We're fixing that with typed error classes, request IDs through the logs, and admin links into the audit trail and OpenSearch.

---

## Current State

What the code looks like before this work lands. Each ticket in the epic replaces a piece of this.

- **`CloudflareService`** (`src/registrar/services/cloudflare_service.py`) — every method catches `httpx.RequestError` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, logs an f-string, and re-raises. Two methods wrap with a generic `APIError(...)`. The httpx client has **no timeout** and **no retries**.
- **`DnsHostService`** (`src/registrar/services/dns_host_service.py`) — wraps Cloudflare exceptions with `raise APIError(str(e)) from e` in a couple of methods. This re-wraps the same error type and produces a second log line for the same failure.
- **View layer** (`src/registrar/views/domain.py`) — catches `(APIError, RequestError)` and shows a generic `messages.error("Failed to save DNS record.")`. JSON responses use two different shapes (`{"status": "error", "message": ...}` and `{"error": ...}`).
- **Exception classes** (`src/registrar/utility/errors.py`) — `NameserverError`, `DsDataError`, and `SecurityEmailError` already follow a typed code-based pattern. DNS hosting has only a bare `APIError(Exception)` with no codes, no subclasses, no status propagation. We mirror the `NameserverError` pattern.
- **Logging** — `logging_context.py` uses ContextVars for `user_email`, `ip_address`, `request_path`, but the middleware that sets them is gated on `IS_PRODUCTION`. `DatabaseConnectionMiddleware` reads `HTTP_X_REQUEST_ID` directly but doesn't share it. DNS service logs are f-strings with no `request_id`, `cf_ray`, `duration_ms`, or `error_code`.
- **Admin** — `DnsRecordAdmin` is minimal. No ModelAdmin for `DnsAccount`, `DnsZone`, or `DnsVendor`. Support can't see DNS operation history from `/admin`.

## The 8 Error Types

When Cloudflare says "no," here's what it means:

| What went wrong | Error name | User sees |
|---|---|---|
| Zone doesn't exist | `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | "We can't find the DNS zone. It might not be set up yet." |
| Record already exists | `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | "There's already a record with that name. Edit the existing one." |
| Bad data | `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | "That data isn't valid." (+ Cloudflare's reason) |
| Too many requests | `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | "You're going too fast. Wait a moment and try again." |
| Permission denied | `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` | "We couldn't reach Cloudflare. Try again later." |
| Network problem | `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | "We couldn't reach Cloudflare. Try again later." |
| Cloudflare down | `DNS_UPSTREAM_ERROR` | "We couldn't reach Cloudflare. Try again later." |
| Something unexpected | `DNS_UNKNOWN` | "We couldn't reach Cloudflare. Try again later." |

**Quick rule:** First 4 are the user's problem (they can fix it). Last 4 are our problem (Cloudflare or network).

### Wire-code reference

Use this when wiring up the exception in code or asserting on it in tests.

| Wire code | Enum | Subclass | Upstream status | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | `ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | `DnsNotFoundError` | 404 | 4xx |
| `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | `RECORD_CONFLICT` | `DnsValidationError` | 409 | 4xx |
| `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | `DnsValidationError` | 400 | 4xx |
| `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `DnsRateLimitError` | 429 | 4xx (retryable) |
| `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` | `AUTH_FAILED` | `DnsAuthError` | 401 / 403 | 5xx-equivalent |
| `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | `DnsTransportError` | (none) | 5xx |
| `DNS_UPSTREAM_ERROR` | `UPSTREAM_ERROR` | `DnsUpstreamError` | 5xx | 5xx |
| `DNS_UNKNOWN` | `UNKNOWN` | `DnsHostingError` (base) | any | 5xx |

Every `DnsHostingError` carries: `code` (enum), `message` (from `_error_mapping`), `upstream_status` (int or None), `context` (dict of primitives). Subclasses are coarse categories; finer distinctions are carried in `code` and `context`, not in new subclasses.

### Captured-errors catalog

The reference for every DNS failure condition we know about today. Update when a new code is added.

| Source | Trigger | Code | User surface | Admin surface | Log level |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare 404 on POST `/zones/.../dns_records` | Zone record not found (stale local DB, race, test fixture) | `DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | Inline: "We couldn't find the DNS zone for this domain. It may not be enrolled in DNS hosting yet." | OpenSearch log line with `error_code=DNS_ZONE_NOT_FOUND` | warning |
| Cloudflare 409 | Duplicate record (same name+type) | `DNS_RECORD_CONFLICT` | Inline field error | OpenSearch log line | warning |
| Cloudflare 400 | Invalid record content | `DNS_VALIDATION_FAILED` | Inline field error (reuse Cloudflare's reason when safe) | OpenSearch log line | warning |
| Cloudflare 429 | Rate limit | `DNS_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | "You're making changes too quickly — please wait a moment and try again." | OpenSearch log line; backoff metadata visible | warning |
| Cloudflare 401 / 403 | Invalid auth token or scope | `DNS_AUTH_FAILED` | Generic "couldn't reach DNS provider" + `request_id` | OpenSearch log line; critical | error |
| httpx `ConnectTimeout` / `ReadTimeout` / `WriteTimeout` | Network blip, Cloudflare slowdown | `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` | Generic + `request_id`, encourage retry | OpenSearch log line; `duration_ms` present | error |
| httpx `ConnectError` / `NetworkError` / DNS failure | Loss of connectivity to Cloudflare | `DNS_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT` (catch-all for transport) | Generic + `request_id` | OpenSearch log line | error |
| Cloudflare 5xx | Provider outage | `DNS_UPSTREAM_ERROR` | Generic + `request_id` | OpenSearch log line | error |
| Any other Cloudflare status | Unexpected | `DNS_UNKNOWN` | Generic + `request_id` | OpenSearch log line with full upstream body (redacted) | error |
| Local model/form validation (existing, out of scope) | Invalid TTL, MX priority, CNAME conflict, bad DNS name | (uses `ValidationError`, not `DnsHostingError`) | Inline form field error | Django admin default | debug |

For successes (DNS record create/update/delete that landed), see django-auditlog at `/admin/auditlog/logentry/`. The catalog above covers failures only.

## How It Works

```
User clicks "Save"
     ↓
View catches the error
     ↓
Log it with a request_id (unique ID for this whole operation)
     ↓
Tell user what happened (friendly message + request_id)
     ↓
In background:
  Success? → Audit log (for admin to see)
  Failure? → OpenSearch (for engineers to investigate)
```

---

## What Developers Do

### 1. Raise Specific Errors

```python
# Don't:
raise APIError("something went wrong")

# Do:
raise DnsNotFoundError(
    code=DnsHostingErrorCodes.ZONE_NOT_FOUND,
    upstream_status=404,
    context={"zone_id": "abc123"}
)
```

### 2. Catch Errors in Views Only

```python
try:
    dns_service.create_record(...)
except DnsHostingError as exc:
    # One place handles all DNS errors
    return dns_error_response(exc)
```

Services raise. Views catch. Simple.

### 3. Include Useful Context

When you raise an error, attach:
- The error code (which one it is)
- The HTTP status from Cloudflare (if there was one)
- Context dict (zone ID, record ID, anything that helps debugging)

### 4. Test the Error Code, Not the Message

```python
# Good — message can change
self.assertEqual(exc.code, DnsHostingErrorCodes.ZONE_NOT_FOUND)

# Bad — breaks when copy changes
self.assertIn("We couldn't find", str(exc))
```

Exceptions must also survive `pickle.dumps`/`pickle.loads` (the parallel test runner serializes them across processes):

```python
def test_my_error_is_picklable(self):
    exc = DnsNotFoundError(code=DnsHostingErrorCodes.ZONE_NOT_FOUND, upstream_status=404)
    restored = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(exc))
    self.assertEqual(restored.code, exc.code)
```

---

## Exception Contract

Three rules for `DnsHostingError` and its subclasses:

1. **Only simple values on the exception.** `str`, `int`, dict-of-primitives. The parallel test runner pickles exceptions across processes; an `httpx.Response` object or a lambda in `context` breaks the pickle and the test run fails in confusing ways.
2. **The code, not the string, is the source of truth.** `_error_mapping` in `errors.py` provides default copy. After sub-ticket #4931 lands, the admin-editable `DnsErrorMessage` table can override it. Tests assert on `exc.code`, never on the message string.
3. **Adding a new error type:** add the enum value, add a subclass if the new category doesn't fit an existing one, add the `_error_mapping` entry, ship a seed migration with the user-facing copy. Update the [Wire-code reference](#wire-code-reference-for-developers) and [Captured-errors catalog](#captured-errors-catalog).

## Network Timeouts & Retries

Sub-ticket [#4923](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4923). All values are in **seconds**. Leads should confirm or adjust before prod.

> Addresses [#4893](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4893)'s description item: *"Define a retry strategy for httpx calls (when to fail fast vs. when to retry)."* Not a formal AC checkbox but called out as a consideration in the planning ticket.

### Timeouts

```python
httpx.Timeout(connect=3, read=10, write=10, pool=5)
```

- `connect=3` — Cloudflare's edge is normally sub-second. 3 seconds covers transient issues without hanging.
- `read=10` / `write=10` — DNS changes are small payloads. 10 seconds is generous but bounded.
- `pool=5` — if we wait longer than 5 seconds for a connection slot, we're under-provisioned and that's worth knowing.

### Hung Cloudflare calls

**Today (no timeout):** a hung Cloudflare call can pin a gunicorn worker until the OS-level TCP keepalive gives up (minutes) or gunicorn kills the worker (often 30s, returns a 502 with no app log).

**After this ticket:** the worst case is bounded.
- **Write calls (POST/PATCH/DELETE — the DNS save path):** no retry. Worst case = one attempt = ~13 seconds (`connect` + `read`).
- **Read calls (GET/HEAD):** up to 2 attempts + 1 backoff pause ≈ ~27 seconds worst case. Sized to fit comfortably inside gunicorn's 30s worker timeout so we never hand a request over to the worker killer.

So adding timeouts + bounded retries holds the worker for **less** time than the current unbounded state, not more. The worker is released cleanly and the user gets a real error response with a `request_id` instead of a 502 from gunicorn.

### Retry: transport level

```python
httpx.HTTPTransport(retries=2)
```

Retries only the *initial connect*. Safe at any HTTP method because httpx only retries before it sees a response — no risk of double-creating a DNS record.

### Retry: at the app level (with backoff)

**Only for read-only calls (GET, HEAD).** Triggers:

- HTTP 429 — wait the number of seconds in the `Retry-After` header, then retry.
- HTTP 5xx — wait with increasing pauses (e.g. 1s, 2s, 4s) with a small random offset so all retries don't land at the same moment.
- Network errors (timeouts, connection drops) — same backoff as 5xx.

Cap at **2 total attempts** in all cases. We deliberately stay under 30 seconds of worker time — gunicorn kills workers that run longer than that, which would turn a recoverable Cloudflare blip into a 502 with no app log.

### Never retry writes (POST, PATCH, DELETE)

Retrying a write that already succeeded but was slow can create a duplicate DNS record. Writes fail fast; the user sees the error with a `request_id` and can decide whether to try again.

---

## What Gets Logged

### Safe to log:
- Request ID
- Zone ID / record ID
- HTTP status codes
- How long the operation took
- Cloudflare's `cf_ray` ID
- Error code names

### Never log:
- Request/response bodies (might contain secrets)
- Cloudflare API keys
- Django cookies
- Raw Python tracebacks (they go to OpenSearch only)
- Passwords or tokens

### Log carefully:
- User email
- Client IP

---

## Support Runbook

User reports: "I got an error. The reference is `abc123-def456`."

**Step 1: Find the error in logs**
- Go to `/admin` → domain → click "DNS logs in OpenSearch"
- Paste request ID or search by domain name
- See everything that happened

**Step 2: Check what they did**
- Click "DNS audit trail" to see successful changes
- Confirm if their action went through or failed

**Step 3: Escalate if needed**
- Find the `cf_ray` value in OpenSearch
- Give Cloudflare that value (not the request ID)

**Step 4: Help the user**
- If 4xx code: tell them how to fix it
- If 5xx code: apologize, ask them to retry

---

## User-Facing Error Messages

### When it's the user's fault (4xx — shown inline):

> "We couldn't find the DNS zone for this domain. It might not be enrolled in DNS hosting yet."

> "A record with that name and type already exists. Edit the existing record instead."

> "The IP address isn't in a valid format."

> "You're making changes too quickly. Please wait a moment and try again."

### When it's our fault (5xx — shown at page level):

> "We couldn't reach our DNS provider. Please try again in a moment. If the problem persists, contact help@get.gov and include this reference: `abc123-def456`."

---

## Admin Panel Features

### Admins will see:

1. **Success tracker** — when DNS records are created/updated/deleted, it appears in an audit log
2. **Quick links** — one click from the domain page to:
   - All DNS changes for this domain (audit log)
   - All recent DNS problems (OpenSearch)
3. **Message editor** — change error copy without deploying code

### Admins won't see:

- Python tracebacks
- Raw Cloudflare responses
- API credentials

---

## Editing Error Messages

Error messages live in a database table (sub-ticket [#4931](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4931)). Go to `/admin` → DNS error messages, edit the row, save. Live immediately. Django audits the change.

---

## Suggested Rollout

Four phases. Each one delivers something usable on its own; earlier phases unblock the later ones.

### Phase 1: Foundations

Building blocks everything else depends on.

- Typed DNS error classes and shared error codes — [#4920](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4920)
- `request_id` flows through every log line — [#4924](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4924)
- One consistent JSON error envelope returned to the browser — [#4925](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4925)

### Phase 2: Service and UI alignment

Wire the new error types into the services and the form.

- `CloudflareService` raises typed errors — [#4921](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4921)
- Remove the duplicate error-wrapping in `DnsHostService` — [#4922](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4922)
- Timeouts + bounded retry on the httpx client — [#4923](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4923)
- Surface `request_id` on the 500 page — [#4928](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4928)
- Register `DnsRecord` / `DnsZone` / `DnsAccount` with `django-auditlog` — [#4996](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4996)
- Design review of user-facing copy — [#4950](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4950)

### Phase 3: Visibility, support, and self-serve copy

Make failures easy to investigate and let Design/Product own the copy.

- Structured fields on every DNS log line — [#4926](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4926)
- Domain admin OpenSearch deep-links + paste box — [#4927](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4927)
- Admin-editable user-facing error copy — [#4931](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4931)
- Developer docs and support runbook finalized — [#4929](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4929)

### Phase 4: Future-facing

Decisions and follow-ups we don't have to make right now.

- Spike: is OpenSearch + structured logs enough for request tracing? — [#4930](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/issues/4930)
- Extend the admin-editable copy pattern to `Nameserver` / `DsData` / `SecurityEmail` if v1 proves out (no ticket yet)

After Phase 1 and Phase 2, we will re-evaluate the scope of Phase 3 and Phase 4.
