## Code Review Verification Steps

### As the original developer, I have

#### Satisfied acceptance criteria and met development standards

- [ ] Met the acceptance criteria, or will meet them in a subsequent PR
- [ ] Created/modified automated tests
- [ ] Update documentation in READMEs and/or onboarding guide

#### Ensured code standards are met (Original Developer)
<!-- Mark "- N/A" and check at the end of each check that is not applicable to your PR -->
- [ ] If any updated dependencies on Pipfile, also update dependencies in requirements.txt.
- [ ] Interactions with external systems are wrapped in try/except
- [ ] Error handling exists for unusual or missing values

#### Validated user-facing changes (if applicable)

- [ ] Tag @gov-designers in this PR's Reviewers for design review. If code is not user-facing, delete design reviewer checklist
- [ ] Verify new pages have been added to .pa11yci file so that they will be tested with our automated accessibility testing
- [ ] Checked keyboard navigability
- [ ] Tested general usability, landmarks, page header structure, and links with a screen reader (such as Voiceover or ANDI)

### As a code reviewer, I have

#### Reviewed, tested, and left feedback about the changes

- [ ] Pulled this branch locally and tested it
- [ ] Verified code meets all checks above. Address any checks that are not satisfied
- [ ] Reviewed this code and left comments. Indicate if comments must be addressed before code is merged
- [ ] Checked that all code is adequately covered by tests
- [ ] Verify migrations are valid and do not conflict with existing migrations
