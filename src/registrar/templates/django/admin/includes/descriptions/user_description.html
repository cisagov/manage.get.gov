<p>
A user is anyone who has access to the registrar. This includes requesters, domain managers, and CISA administrators. 
Within each user record, you can review that user’s permissions and user status.
</p>

<p>
If a user has a domain request in ineligible status, then their user status will be “restricted.” 
Users who are in restricted status cannot create/edit domain requests or approved domains, 
and their existing requests are locked. They will see a 403 error if  they try to take action in the registrar.
</p>

<p>
Each user record displays the associated “contact” info for that user, 
which is the same info found in the <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_contact_changelist' %}">Contacts</a> table. 
Updating these details on the user record will also update the corresponding contact record for that user.
