<p>Waffle flags control whether certain features are turned on or off in the registrar.</p>

<p>
    You can adjust settings for specific user groups (superusers, staff), but the setting for "Everyone" 
    takes priority and overrides individual group settings. 
</p>

<p>If “Everyone” is set to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unknown</strong> > the system will use the specific settings for each user group</li>
    <li><strong>No</strong> > the feature will be turned off for all user groups</li>
    <li><strong>Yes</strong> > the feature will be turned on for all user groups</li>
</ul>
