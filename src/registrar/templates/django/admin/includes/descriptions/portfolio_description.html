<p>
    This table contains all portfolios in the registrar. 
    Portfolios are used to group an organization with all its domains, requests, suborganizations, and members.
</p>

<p>
    For portfolio organizations, the mailing address is stored in this table, and the senior official is listed in the 
    <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_seniorofficial_changelist' %}">Senior officials</a> table. 
    For non-portfolio organizations, that information is managed at the domain or request level.
