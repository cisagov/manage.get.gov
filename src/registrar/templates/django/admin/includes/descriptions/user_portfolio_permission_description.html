    This table represents the members of each portfolio in the registrar. There are separate records for each member/portfolio combination.
</p>

<p>
    Each member is assigned one of two access levels: admin or basic. Only admins can manage member permissions and organization metadata.

    If you add or remove someone to a portfolio by using this table, those actions wonâ€™t trigger notification emails.
