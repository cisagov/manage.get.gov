    This table contains all individuals who have been invited to become members of a portfolio.
    These individuals must log in to the registrar to officially accept and become a member.
</p>

<p>
    An “invited” status indicates that the recipient has not logged in to the registrar since the invitation
    was sent or that the recipient has logged in but is already a member of another portfolio. A “received” 
    status indicates that the recipient has logged in.
</p>

<p>
    If you invite someone to a portfolio by using this table, they’ll receive an email notification. 
    If you assign them "admin" access, the existing portfolio admins will also be notified. However, canceling an invitation here won’t trigger any emails.
