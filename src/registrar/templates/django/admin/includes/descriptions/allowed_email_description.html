<p>
    This table contains all email addresses that have been added to the allowlist for 
    <strong>non-production</strong> environments.
</p>
<p>
    If an email is triggered and the intended recipient doesn’t appear within this table 
    (or isn’t a subset of an entry in this table), then the message won’t be sent to that email address.
</p>
<p>
    If this table is populated in a production environment, it won’t have an effect on sending emails and 
    will simply be ignored.
