<p>This table includes all senior officials that can be associated with a portfolio organization.</p>

<p>
    To maintain data integrity, each organization should have only one senior official. 
    When adding a new senior official, selecting a federal agency will automatically link the official to that agencyâ€™s portfolio.
</p>

<p>
    The senior official for non-portfolio organizations is managed at the domain or request level. 
    Those contacts do not appear in this table.
