    This table contains anyone listed in a non-portfolio domain request, including other employees 
    and senior officials. They aren't necessarily users with an account for the registrar unless 
    they are also in the <a class="text-underline" href="{% url 'admin:registrar_user_changelist' %}">Users</a> table.

    Updating someone’s contact information here will not affect that person’s User record or Login.gov information.
