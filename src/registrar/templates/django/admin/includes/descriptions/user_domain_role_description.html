    This table represents the managers who are assigned to each domain in the registrar. There are separate records for each domain/manager combination. 
    Managers can update information related to a domain, such as DNS data and security contact.

    The requester automatically becomes a manager for that domain.
    Anyone who retrieves a domain invitation will also appear in this table as a manager.

    If you add or remove someone to a domain by using this table, those actions wonâ€™t trigger notification emails.
