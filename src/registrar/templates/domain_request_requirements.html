  <p>Please read this page. Check the box at the bottom to show that you agree to the requirements for operating a .gov domain.</p>
  <p>The .gov domain space exists to support a broad diversity of government missions. Generally, we don’t review or audit how government organizations use their registered domains. However, misuse of a .gov domain can reflect upon the integrity of the entire .gov space. There are categories of misuse that are statutorily prohibited or abusive in nature.</p>


  <h2>What you can’t do with a .gov domain</h2>

  <h3>Commercial purposes</h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used for <a class="usa-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="{% public_site_url 'help/faq#commercial-purposes' %}">commercial purposes</a>, such as advertising that benefits private individuals or entities.</p>

  <h3>Political campaigns</h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used for political campaign purposes, such as the website for a candidate seeking elected office.</p>

  <h3>Illegal content</h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not be used to distribute or promote material whose distribution violates applicable law.</p>

  <h3>Malicious cyber activity </h3>

  <p>A .gov domain must not distribute malware, host open redirects, or engage in malicious cyber activity.</p>

  <h2>What .gov domain registrants must do</h2>

  <h3>Keep your contact information updated</h3>

  <p>.Gov domain registrants must maintain accurate contact information in the .gov registrar. You will be asked to verify it as part of the renewal process.</p>

  <h3>Be responsive if we contact you</h3>

  <p>.Gov domain registrants must respond promptly to communications about potential violations to these requirements.</p>

  <h2 class="margin-bottom-0">Failure to comply could result in domain suspension or termination</h2>

  <p class="margin-top-105">We may need to suspend or terminate a domain registration for violations of these requirements. When we discover a violation, we’ll make reasonable efforts to contact a registrant, including emails or phone calls to:
    <ul class="usa-list"> 
      <li>Domain contacts</li>
      <li>The senior official</li>
      <li>The government organization, a parent organization, or affiliated entities</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>We understand the critical importance of availability for a .gov domain. Suspending or terminating a .gov domain is reserved for prolonged, unresolved, serious violations where the registrant is non-responsive. We'll make extensive efforts to contact registrants and to identify potential solutions. We'll make reasonable accommodations for remediation timelines based on the severity of the issue.</p>

  <h2 class="margin-bottom-0">Domain renewal</h2>
  
  <p class="margin-top-105">.Gov domains are registered for a one-year period. To renew the domain, you’ll be asked to verify your contact information and some details about the domain.</p>
  
  <p>Though a domain may expire, it will not automatically be put on hold or deleted. We’ll make extensive efforts to contact your organization before holding or deleting a domain.</p>

      <h3>Prohibitions on non-governmental use</h3>

      <p>Agencies may not use a .gov domain name:
        <ul class="usa-list"> 
          <li>On behalf of a non-federal executive branch entity</li>
          <li>For a non-governmental purpose</li>
