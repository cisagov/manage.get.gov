Hi, domain managers. 

On {{ expiration_date }}, the following domain will expire: {{ domain }}

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

HOW TO RENEW A DOMAIN
There’s no cost to renew a domain. After renewal, the domain will be registered for another year. 

Any domain manager can complete the process within the .gov registrar <{{ manage_url }}>. {% if portfolio %} Organization admins are cc’d on this email for awareness but do not need to take action. {% endif %}

WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DOMAIN EXPIRES?
When a .gov domain expires, it’s not automatically put on hold or deleted. It continues to resolve online even after its expiration date. Before we delete the domain, we’ll make an extensive effort to contact your organization. We encourage you to renew the domain promptly if you're still using it.

If you no longer need {{ domain }}, you can request that it be deleted. Learn more about deleting a domain <https://get.gov/help/domain-management/#delete-a-gov-domain>
