Hi, domain managers.

We received a request to delete the following domain: {{ domain.name }}

DELETION REQUESTED BY: {{ requestor_email }}
REQUEST RECEIVED ON: {{ date }}
STATUS: On hold

We placed the domain on hold for seven days as a precautionary measure before deleting it. After the domain is deleted, it can’t be recovered. 

If you would like to release the hold and cancel the deletion, reply to this email.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES “ON HOLD” MEAN?

When a domain is placed on hold: 

- The domain and its subdomains no longer resolve in DNS. 
- Any email or websites using the domain could become unavailable.
- Domain managers can’t edit domain information.

The domain is still registered to your organization until it’s officially deleted.
