WHAT DOES “ON HOLD” MEAN?

When a domain is placed on hold: 

- The domain and its subdomains no longer resolve in DNS. 
- Any infrastructure (like websites) are offline.
- Domain managers can’t edit domain information.

Although the domain is still registered to your organization, it’s administratively paused. These changes can be undone if the .gov team releases the hold.

WHY ARE DOMAINS PLACED “ON HOLD”?

In general, there are a handful of reasons we place a domain on hold: 
- There was an authorized request to delete the domain, so we temporarily placed it on hold as a precautionary measure before deleting. 
- The domain registration was not renewed.
- Prolonged, unresolved, serious violations of .gov’s registration requirements occurred, and our outreach about these violations was unsuccessful. Learn more about these requirements <https://get.gov/domains/requirements>.
- The original domain registration was deemed unauthorized.

A domain is typically placed on hold for seven calendar days before deletion. Unauthorized requests may be deleted sooner.
