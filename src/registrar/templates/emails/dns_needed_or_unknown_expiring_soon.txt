Hi, domain managers.  

On {{ expiration_date }}, the following domain will expire: {{ domain }}

----------------------------------------------------------------

DOMAIN AT RISK FOR DELETION 
Currently, {{ domain }} doesn’t have name servers listed in the .gov registrar. If the domain expires without name servers, it will be deleted. To prevent deletion, you must renew this domain before {{ expiration_date }}.

HOW TO RENEW A DOMAIN
There’s no cost to renew a domain. After renewal, the domain will be registered for another year. 

Any domain manager can complete the process within the .gov registrar <{{ manage_url }}>. {% if portfolio %} Organization admins are cc’d on this email for awareness but do not need to take action.{% endif %}

If you no longer need {{ domain }}, simply let the domain expire. We’ll delete the domain after expiration.
