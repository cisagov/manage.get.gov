Hi, domain managers.

On {{ date|date }}, the following domain was deleted: {{ domain.name }}

You can view this status update in the .gov registrar {{ manage_url }}

----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES “DELETED” MEAN?
When a domain is deleted: 
    - The domain and its subdomains no longer resolve in DNS. 
    - Any email or websites using the domain are unavailable.
    - Domain managers can't edit domain information.

The domain is no longer registered to your organization, but it will appear in your list of domains with a “deleted” status. 

These changes are permanent.
