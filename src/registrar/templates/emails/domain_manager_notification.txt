NEXT STEPS
The person who received the invitation will become a domain manager once they log in to the
.gov registrar. They'll need to access the registrar using a Login.gov account that's
associated with the invited email address.

If you need to cancel this invitation or remove the domain manager, you can do that by going to 
this domain in the .gov registrar <{{ manage_url }}>.


WHY DID YOU RECEIVE THIS EMAIL? 
You’re listed as a domain manager for {{ domain.name }}, so you’ll receive a notification whenever
someone is invited to manage that domain.
