Hi,{% if domain_manager and domain_manager.first_name %} {{ domain_manager.first_name }}.{% endif %}

A domain manager was invited to {{ domain.name }}.
DOMAIN: {{ domain.name }}
INVITED BY: {{ requestor_email }}
INVITED ON: {{date}}
MANAGER INVITED: {{ invited_email_address }}


----------------------------------------------------------------


NEXT STEPS

The person who received the invitation will become a domain manager once they log in to the
.gov registrar. They'll need to access the registrar using a Login.gov account that's
associated with the invited email address.

If you need to cancel this invitation or remove the domain manager (because they've already
logged in), you can do that by going to this domain in the .gov registrar <https://manage.get.gov/>.


WHY DID YOU RECEIVE THIS EMAIL? 

You’re listed as a domain manager for {{ domain.name }}, so you’ll receive a notification whenever
someone is invited to manage that domain.

If you have questions or concerns, reach out to the person who sent the invitation or reply to this email.


THANK YOU
.Gov helps the public identify official, trusted information. Thank you for using a .gov domain.
