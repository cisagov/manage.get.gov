Hi, domain managers.  

On {{ date_of_deletion }}, the following domain was deleted: {{ domain.name }}

The domain was deleted because it expired and no name servers were added to the .gov registrar after registration. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES “DELETED” MEAN?
When a domain is deleted: 

    - The domain and its subdomains no longer resolve in DNS. 
    - Any infrastructure (like websites) are offline.
    - Domain managers can’t edit domain information.

The domain is no longer registered to your organization, but it will appear in your list of domains with a “deleted” status. 

These changes are permanent.

SOMETHING WRONG?

.Gov helps the public identify official, trusted information. Thank you for using a .gov
