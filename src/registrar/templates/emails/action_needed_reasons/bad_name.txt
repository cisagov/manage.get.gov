DOMAIN NAME DOES NOT MEET .GOV REQUIREMENTS
We've reviewed your domain request and, unfortunately, it does not meet our naming requirements. 

Domains should uniquely identify a government organization and be clear to the general public. Read more about naming requirements for your type of organization <https://get.gov/domains/choosing/>. 


ACTION NEEDED
First, we need you to identify a new domain name that meets our naming requirements for your type of organization. Then, log in to the registrar and update the name in your domain request. <{{ manage_url }}> Once you submit your updated request, we’ll resume the adjudication process.

If you have questions or want to discuss potential domain names, reply to this email.
