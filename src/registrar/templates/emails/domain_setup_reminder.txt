Hi, domain managers.

Your domain request for $domain.gov was approved, but the domain is not yet online. You’ll need to complete the following actions before your .gov domain is active:

ADD DOMAIN NAME SERVER INFORMATION

Before your .gov domain can be used, you’ll first need to connect it to a Domain Name System (DNS) hosting service. At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services. 
After you’ve set up hosting, you’ll need to enter your name server information on the .gov registrar.
