ADD DOMAIN NAME SERVER INFORMATION
Before your .gov domain can be used, you’ll first need to connect it to a Domain Name System (DNS) hosting service. At this time, we don’t provide DNS hosting services. 

After you’ve set up hosting, you’ll need to enter your name server information on the .gov registrar.

- Finding a DNS hosting service <https://get.gov/domains/moving/#find-dns-hosting-services>
- Adding name servers <https://get.gov/help/domain-management/#manage-dns-name-servers>.


ADD DOMAIN MANAGERS, SECURITY EMAIL
Currently, you’re the only person who can manage this domain. Please keep your contact information updated. 

We strongly recommend adding other domain managers who can serve as additional contacts. We also recommend providing a security email that the public can use to report security issues on your domain. You can add domain managers and a security email on the .gov registrar.

WE’LL PRELOAD THIS DOMAIN
We add new .gov domains to the HSTS preload list each month. This requires browsers to use a secure HTTPS connection to any website at this domain and ensures the content you publish is exactly what your visitors get. It also means you’ll need to support HTTPS anywhere the domain is used for websites – on the internet or internally. We’ll add your domain to the preload list soon.
