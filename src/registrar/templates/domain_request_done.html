  <p>We’ll email a copy of your request to you.</p>

  <h2>Next steps in this process</h2>

  <p> We’ll review your request. This review period can take 30 business days. Due to the volume of requests, the wait time is longer than usual. We appreciate your patience.</p> 
    
  <p>During our review we’ll verify that:</p> 
  <ul class="usa-list">
    <li>Your organization is eligible for a .gov domain.</li>
    <li>You work at the organization and/or can make requests on its behalf.</li> 
    <li>Your requested domain meets our naming requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> We’ll email you if we have questions. We’ll also email you as soon as we complete our review. You can <a href="{% url 'home' %}">check the status</a>
      of your request at any time on the registrar homepage.</p> 
  
  <p> <a class="usa-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="{% public_site_url 'contact' %}">Contact us if you need help during this process</a>.</p>
