        This class method is a factory for creating dynamic methods that will be attached
        to the ModelAdmin subclass.
        It is used to customize how fk fields are ordered.

        In essence, this function will more or less generate code that looks like this,
        for a given tuple defined in orderable_fk_fields:

        ```
        def get_sortable_requested_domain(self, obj):
            return obj.requested_domain
        # Allows column order sorting
        get_sortable_requested_domain.admin_order_field = "requested_domain__name"
        # Sets column's header name
        get_sortable_requested_domain.short_description = "requested domain"
        ```

        Or for fields with multiple order_fields:

        ```
        def get_sortable_creator(self, obj):
            return obj.creator
        # Allows column order sorting
        get_sortable_creator.admin_order_field = ["creator__first_name", "creator__last_name"]
        # Sets column's header
        get_sortable_creator.short_description = "creator"
        ```

        Parameters:
        cls: The class that this method is being called on. In the context of this mixin,
        it would be the ModelAdmin subclass.
        field: A string representing the name of the attribute that
        the dynamic method will fetch from the model instance.
        sort_field: A string or list of strings representing the
        field(s) to sort by (ex: "name" or "creator")

        Returns:
        method: The dynamically created method.

        The dynamically created method has the following attributes:
        __name__: A string representing the name of the method. This is set to "get_{field}".
        admin_order_field: A string or list of strings representing the field(s) that
        Django should sort by when the column is clicked in the admin interface.
        short_description: A string used as the column header in the admin interface.
        Will replace underscores with spaces.
