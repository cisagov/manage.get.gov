"""
Custom views that allow for error view customization.

Used as a general handler for 500 errors both coming from the registrar app, but
also the djangooidc app.

If Djangooidc is left to its own devices and uses reverse directly,
then both context and session information will be obliterated due to:

a) Djangooidc being out of scope for context_processors
b) Potential cyclical import errors restricting what kind of data is passable.

Rather than dealing with that, we keep everything centralized in one location.
